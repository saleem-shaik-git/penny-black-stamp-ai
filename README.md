# Penny Black Stamp Plate Identification – AI System

**Author:** Saleem Shaik  
**Role:** Founder & Technical Lead  
**Project Start:** November 2024  

## Overview
This repository documents the technical design and AI approach for an image
recognition system intended to identify Penny Black stamp plate numbers (1–11).

The project addresses a long-standing challenge in philately caused by worn
postmarks and visual degradation of historic stamps.

## My Role
I conceived the idea and designed the AI-based approach for plate identification.
My responsibilities include defining the machine learning strategy, data
preprocessing techniques, and evaluation methodology.

## Innovation
The innovation lies in applying modern image recognition techniques to a
historical artefact domain where training data is limited and image quality
is highly variable.

## Project Status
This project is in the research and pre-implementation phase.
